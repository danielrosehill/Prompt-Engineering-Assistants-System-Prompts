## Quick Start

1. **Browse**: Navigate through the folders to find prompts relevant to your needs
2. **View**: Each file contains a description and the full system prompt text
3. **Copy**: Copy the system prompt (text between triple backticks) 
4. **Use**: Paste into your preferred AI assistant platform

## How to Use These Prompts

These system prompts can be used on any assistant creation platform that supports custom system prompts, including but not limited to:

1. **OpenAI's ChatGPT/GPT Builder**
   - Navigate to "Create a GPT" or "Custom Instructions"
   - Copy the system prompt content (the text between the triple backticks in the .md files)
   - Paste into the "System Prompt" or "Instructions" field

2. **Anthropic's Claude**
   - Use the system prompt in the "System Prompt" field when creating a custom Claude assistant
   - For the Claude web interface, you can prefix your first message with "System: [paste prompt here]"

3. **Open Source Models (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)**
   - Include the system prompt in your initial configuration
   - Format according to the specific model's requirements (some may use different system prompt markers)

4. **Hugging Face Spaces**
   - Use the system prompt in the appropriate configuration field when setting up your assistant

### General Usage Tips

1. **Customization**: Feel free to modify these prompts to better suit your specific needs
2. **Combining Prompts**: You can often combine elements from different prompts to create a more tailored experience
3. **Testing**: Always test prompts with different inputs to ensure they produce the desired results
4. **Iteration**: Prompt engineering is iterative - use these as starting points and refine based on results
